# vim-ocra

## Installation

Vim has a number of plugins that ease the pains of plugin management. My method
of choice is [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). If you've
already set that up then this is all you need:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git
```

## Docs

I will add a tutorial in the future, but until then I'll just leave you with
[the vim docs](https://github.com/nicr9/vim-orca/blob/master/doc/orca.txt).
